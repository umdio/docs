     <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
     <p><p>Don’t just skip these! By using the site and the API, you automatically agree to these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>umd.io is built by students for students - we aren’t the school, and we aren’t a corporation. We try to provide the best tool that we can, and we know that he better service we provide, the more students will rely on it, and the better everyone’s experience will be.</p>

<p>That being said, we can’t guarantee that the API will always work the way it is documented, the way it should, or even work at all! We’re offering the service to be helpful, and we are licensed so that you can use it for any kind of project - a small one for yourself or for class, or a for-profit business. Still, we make no warranties or guarantees of any kind, and you, by using the site and service, fully indemnify and hold harmless umd.io and everyone associated with it. You also agree to limit our liability as much as the law permits.</p>

<p>We don’t currently have any rate limits, but we might at some point, at will at that time update these terms. We reserve the right to limit your use or even shut you out entirely. We would likely only do this to protect the service, such as if you made so many calls to the API that it couldn’t handle it.</p>

<p>We don’t collect any personally identifiable information, but the IP address of whatever application is calling the API will probably end up in log files. We don’t share these with anyone, and they would be tough for someone to steal, but again, we don’t guarantee anything.</p>

<p>We’re based in Prince George’s County, Maryland, and if it came to it, you agree that any legal dispute would be settled in those courts.</p>

<p>These terms went into effect on 5/5/2015, when they were written. If they are updated, we’ll post the notice here, and the changes will go into effect 15 days after they are posted here.</p>
